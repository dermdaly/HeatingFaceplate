I have 3 Siemens RWB 27 wall switches which operate my heating:
Switch 1 turns on/off the boiler.
Switch 2 turns on/off the valve to send hot water to the downstairs radiators
Swtich 3 turns on/off the valve to send hot water to the upstaird radiators.

I'm planning on changing all of this for 3 shelly gen3 mini relays, so I can control them from Apple Home/Home Assitant.

I'm designing a faceplate I can put into the wall.

1. Utilising a standard 2 gang drywall electrical box.
2. Designin my own face plate to hold the electronics

Specifically, the face plate will have
3 230V AC Indicator LEDs which will show if a particular switch is on or off.
3 IKEA Bilresa switches to allow someone in the room to boost the switches.

The original switches has a boost button: 
Pressed once - boost for 1 hour
Pressed twice - boost for 2 hours
Pressed three times - boost for 3 hours.

I plan on doing this using Automation.
